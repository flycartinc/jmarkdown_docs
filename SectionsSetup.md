# Sections

Consider you are writing documentation for one product. You might be having several files and you cannot display all the files under one section and it will not be look good. For example, Usually every product should have configuration and settings. So you are having set of four .md files related to configuration (such as configuration.md, currencies.md, setup.md). So create a section "Configuration".
