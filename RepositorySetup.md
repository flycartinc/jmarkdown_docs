# Repository

A Github repository is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will have its own repo, and can be accessed by a unique URL. For example, consider our products Axisubs, JMarkDown and AxisMeta. Documentation for all the products are written in .md format and maintained in Github repositories. To display those documentation (.md files) in the site, we have developed JMarkDown and fetch the documentation from Github repositories and display them in the site. Lets see how to create repository in Github and maintaining .md files.
