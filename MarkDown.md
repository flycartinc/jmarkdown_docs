# Mark Down

##### History

HTML just begs for typos. Even the smallest, one-letter tags require three characters to open them and four characters to close. If you forget a slash or accidentally type an apostrophe instead of a quotation mark, your whole page could be screwed up. And especially if you’re in a hurry, the errors can be hard to spot.

Plenty of tools assist with HTML writing by highlighting errors on the fly, but why rely on those?
Markdown’s simplicity and flexibility help you make fewer mistakes, and errors are much easier to find.
